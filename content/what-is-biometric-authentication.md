Biometric authentication refers to security processes that authenticate a user's identity through unique biological characteristics such as retinas, voices, facial, and fingerprints. Biometric authentication systems store this biometric data to verify a user's identity when authenticating their account.

The word biometric is a combination of bio (human) and metric (measurement). In simpler terms, biometrics are metrics related to human features that make an individual different from others.

Biometric data is unique to individual users, and biometric authentication is generally more secure than other authentication. Biometric authentication is a rapidly growing technology that can help businesses ensure that only the right people access sensitive information.

## How Does the Biometric Authentication Work?

Biometric authentication works by comparing two datasets. The first one is preset(already saved in DB) by the device's owner, while the second dataset belongs to a device visitor. If the two datasets are nearly identical, the device knows that "visitor" and "owner" are the same and access the person.

The match between the two datasets must be **almost identical** but not **accurately similar**. This is because two biometric data can't match 100%. For Example, you might have a minor injury that changes the print pattern.

Designing the process so that it doesn't require an exact 100% match dramatically diminishes the chance of a false negative (the device doesn't recognize your fingerprint). It increases the odds that a fake fingerprint might be considered genuine.

## Advantages of biometric authentication

1. **Speedy authentication:** It is easy and quick to validate your identity via fingerprint, voice, or face ID. You don't need to remember a difficult password or carry keys to authenticate your identity.
2. **Improves user accountability:** Biometric Authentication needs the appearance of the person. It then generates valid and auditable records showing who exactly tried to access a system. Biometric Authentication provides irrefutable evidence on who was trying to access the system; it invariably improves user accountability.
3. **Non-transferable:** Biometric authentication requires its input to be present in the authorization. You can't share a physical biometric digitally. You need to be present there for an authentication process.
4. **Near spoof-proof**: Biometrics like face patterns, fingerprints, and others are near-impossible to replicate with current technology, and it is near-impossible that your fingerprint will match up 100% with someone else's fingerprint.

## The future of Biometric Authentication

According to a report, the global biometrics market is expected to post a CAGR of more than [15%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191127005446/en/Global-Biometrics-Market-2019-2023-Development-New-Products) during 2019-2023.

Accordingly, as we've adopted digitization, we also have to put effort into securing and verifying our identities with passwords, IDs, smart cards, etc. However, with Biometrics Authentication, we can authenticate our identities by just using our unique biometric characteristics.

So, it looks like we are ready to drop the burden of carrying and remembering passwords and adopt an uncomplicated yet highly efficient way of making our digital identities incredibly secure.

One of such products is **MojoAuth** passwordless login feature. It provides a seamless and convenient passwordless authentication which is easy to use, reliable, stable, and secure.
