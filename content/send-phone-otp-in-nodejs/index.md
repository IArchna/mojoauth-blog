You get some free credits to start using Twilio to send text messages. 

## Step 2: Configuration of Twilio Account

You can find credentials you need TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID , TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, and TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER from the Twilio console, which helps us send simple HTTP POST (a Twillio API) for sending an SMS. 

We have this super simple library that provides Twilio implementation. Install the Twilio-node library from the terminal using npm:

```js
npm install Twilio
```
## Step 3: Implementation of Twilio 

Create a file named index.js and open it in your favorite text editor. At the top of the file, require the Twilio-node helper library. 

```js
const twilio = require('twilio');
```
As we already defined, the credentials of Twilio, which you can find in the console of Twilio.

try the code

```js
const accountSid = 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'; // Your Account SID from www.twilio.com/console
const authToken = 'your_auth_token'; // Your Auth Token from www.twilio.com/console

const twilio = require('twilio');
const client = new twilio(accountSid, authToken);

client.messages
  .create({
    body: 'Hello from Node',
    to: '+12345678901', // Text this number
    from: '+12345678901', // From a valid Twilio number
  })
  .then((message) => console.log(message.sid));

```

Wow, you have completed the SMS provider setup!! and for the implementation authentication, many steps are their many steps are there 

## Trial Limitations
Twilio Free Trial projects have some restrictions on their projects. For a list of the limitations, you may check out Twilio [Free Trial Limitations](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036052753-Twilio-Free-Trial-Limitations). At this time, when I am writing this blog, twillio gives 16$ in credits to a free trial account.

To remove these restrictions, you can upgrade to a paid project account which costs according to current plans.
