WebAuthn is a browser-based API that allows websites to use built-in authenticators or secure keys to authenticate users. When a user registers, a public-private key pair is generated for the account. The private key is securely stored in the user's device, while the public key is sent to the server. Then, the server can use the private key to ask the user's device to sign a "challenge" to verify the user's identity.

## How It Works

WebAuthn works in two different scenarios: registration and authentication.

**Registration** makes the authenticator generate a new set of public-key credentials to sign a challenge caused by the relying party(your website). The public part of these newly developed credentials, along with the signed challenge, can be sent back to your website(relying party) for database storage. The relying party uses these credentials to verify the user whenever login performs.

**Authentication** allows the relying party(your website) to send a challenge to the authenticator, and the same can then be signed with the earlier generated public-key credentials and sent back to the relying party(like your website).

In this way, the relying party can verify that a user has the required credentials, proving their identity.
There are two types of authenticators.

**Roaming authenticators** - Connect to your devices through USB, Bluetooth,NFC etc.
**Platform authenticators** - These are built-in your system like a fingerprint, windows -Windows Hello, FaceID, Touch ID etc.

Both processes work with the help of a public key and a private key concept. The private key is secret, and only the authenticator needs to know it. Anyone can store the public key and use it to verify signatures generated by the private key. Other than the private key, there is no other key that can generate a signature that can verify by the public key as valid. This way, the relying party can store a public key and verify signatures performed by the user holding the private key.

## The Future of Passwordless Access

The Dark Web is rife with collections of data breaches: millions of usernames/emails and passwords can be found in a single data leak "dump". That's because currently, websites use username/emails and passwords for an authentication process. If that data leaks publicly,anybody can use that information to see whether you've used the passwords on any given platform. That can lead to a problem where hackers gain access to more and more of your personal information.
WebAuthn doesn't ask for a password. It's following the recommended security practice of creating a unique password for every website because it creates an authentication token each time you log in. And you don't need to remember your password.

## WebAuthn for Multi-Factor Authentication

WebAuthn enables Identity Providers like Facebook, Google, and Amazon to implement an authentication strategy that allows users to define which authenticator makes the most sense. So, instead of the sites you visit choosing which authenticator should be used for MFA, the user can decide which authenticator they would like to use. Maybe you'd like to use your fingerprint reader as your second factor or a YubiKey. The user can determine which authentication factor makes the most sense for them.
WebAuthn is new, and it is a unique experience for many users, so you will be experiencing a more secure, scalable, and robust web authentication experience shortly.
