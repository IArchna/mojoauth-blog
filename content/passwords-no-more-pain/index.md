1. Use a unique password for every website
2. Use long passwords 
3. Include some random characters
4. Donâ€™t follow common patterns
5. Only store passwords in a secure location
6. Security is essential, but so is convenience

These are the things the user needs to remember before creating an account on a website or application with password authentication.
