Across the internet, phishing attacks have gained popularity among the scammers who try to steal your personal information and harm you or your company. These phishing emails can look deceivingly credible, and scammers can explicitly personalize some for you.

## What are Phishing attacks?

Phishing attacks are one of the practices of sending fraudulent emails that appear to come from a credible source. It persuades you to take action mainly by clicking a link attached in their email, which gives the scammer access to your device, information, or account. It is a common type of cyber attack that one should know how to avoid.

## How does phishing attacks work?

Anyone with access to the internet or phones can be a target for phishing attacks.
Phishing scams usually try to:

- **Infect your device with malware**
- **Steal your account information to get your money or identity**
- **Get control of your online accounts**
- **Convince you to send money or valuables willingly**

Sometimes, it just doesn't end with you. If a scammer gets hold of your account, they can use it to deceive people in your contact list or social media, which would seem to be coming from you.

## How to recognize phishing attacks?

Scammers through Emails and text messages often tell you a story to trick you into opening an attachment or clicking on a link.

They may say they've:

- **Noticed some suspicious activity or login attempts**
- **Noticed a problem with your account or your payment information**
- **Sent you an invoice which is a fake one**
- **Sent you a link and want you to make payment**
- **Sent you a refund**
- **Offered some free stuff or coupons**

People often fall for one of these lucrative scams and lose their valuable information or account to the scammers.

## How to prevent falling for phishing attacks?

The best practice to prevent falling under these phishing attacks is to be vigilant and aware of the emails you receive. Here are some of the ways which can help you avoid such scams:

### 1. **Know what you are dealing with.**

Scammers are developing new phishing attack methods all the time, but they have commonalities that you can look for and identify. Many sites online will keep you informed of the latest phishing attacks and their key identifiers. The earlier you learn about these latest attack methods, the more likely you will avoid a potential attack.

### 2. **Think before you click.**

You should never click the link sent to you or open the attachment with your eyes closed, even if you know the sender. The simple method you should follow is hovering over the link to see if the destination is correct. Some phishing attacks are reasonably sophisticated. Scammers may set up the destination URL to record keystrokes or steal login/credit card information. If you can go straight to the site through your search engine rather than click on the link, then you should do so.

### 3. **Change your passwords every month.**

It would be best if you made a habit of changing your passwords regularly to prevent an attacker from gaining unlimited access. Scammers can compromise your account without you knowing, so adding that extra layer of protection through password rotation can prevent ongoing attacks and potential lockout attackers.

### 4. **Don't be tempted by those pop-ups.**

Pop-ups are often linked to malware and are a part of attempted phishing attacks. Most browsers now have the feature to download and install free ad-blocker software that will automatically block most malicious pop-ups. If one of the pop-ups does manage to evade the ad-blocker, though, you should always check the pop-up before clicking.

### 5. **Get free add-ons for anti-phishing.**

Nowadays, most browsers will help you download add-ons that spot the signs of a malicious website or alert you about known phishing sites. They are usually entirely free, so there's no reason not to have this installed on every device in your organization.

### 6. **Beware of an unsecured site.**

It would be best not to trust any unsecured websites with sensitive information or download files from the sites that don't start with "HTTPS." Site's without security certificates may not be used as phishing scams, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

### 7. **Don't ignore those security updates.**

Don't put your numerous update messages on hold. Security patches and updates for your browser and system are released for a reason, most commonly to keep your system up to date with modern attacks by patching holes in security. Not updating your browser could lead to a risk of phishing attacks through known vulnerabilities that you could have easily avoided.

### 8. **Install firewalls**

Firewalls effectively act as a shield between your computer and an attacker and prevent external attacks. Both desktop firewalls and network firewalls can bolster your security and reduce the chances of a hacker infiltrating your environment when used together.

### 9. **Don't give out vital information.**

You should not give out your card information to a website unless you 100% trust the source. If you have to provide your information, ensure that the website is genuine, that the company is honest, and that the site is secure.

### 10. **Have a Data Security Platform that spots signs of an attack.**

If you ever fall for a successful phishing attack, it's essential that you detect and react promptly. A data security platform helps release the pressure from the IT/Security team by automatically alerting unwanted changes to files and anomalous user behavior. If an attacker gets access to your sensitive information, those data security platforms can help to identify the targeted account so that you can take action to prevent further damage.
