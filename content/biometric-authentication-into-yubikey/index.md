Security keys are easy to use, prevent phishing attacks, affordable, easy to use, and more secure than any other two-factor authentication.

The biometric security key is a new generation of passwordless authentication. In this, we use a biometric authentication built right into a security key.


## Yubikey Bio 

Yubico has launched the [YubiKey Bio](https://www.yubico.com/blog/getting-a-biometric-security-key-right/), which supports biometric authentication for passwordless logins and multifactor authentication. 

In the Yubikey Bio, Once a fingerprint is enrolled on the device, the data is stored in a secure element. At the same time, the biometric subsystem runs independently of the key's core security functionality. All communication between the particular component and the rest of the key is encrypted to help prevent replay attacks.

The YubiKey Bio does not require any drivers or additional software. Instead, this is designed to integrate with the native biometric enrollment and management features supported in the latest operating systems.

4. You can use biometric authentication on every laptop. 


## The future of Yubikey Bio

The YubiKey Bio keys are part of a developing campaign to overthrow passwords, the supreme method for login technology. Passwords are familiar but face a host of security deficiencies. They can be stolen, misremembered, reused, and easily guessed. 

But the hardware security keys, the tech industry is easing password problems with biometrics, phone authentication apps, and an authentication standard called FIDO.


## Integrate Yubikey Bio Feature

You can use biometric security key in your website via adding a passwordless solution on your website. MojoAuth allows you to integrate passwordless login using the biometric security key, magic link, email OTP. It is easy to integrate into any of your websites.
